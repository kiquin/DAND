<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>My data visualization&#39;s goal is to provide more information on delayed flights, to understand them better. By using data from 2008 we can visualize how many flights are delayed during a year and how long those delays are. The data can usually be filtered by month, as to be able to see the effect of holidays and seasons; it&#39;s also possible to chose specific carriers. At the end, I show the causes of delay and a visualization of how common each one is.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>I focused on utilizing the DepDelay field in the <a href="http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html">data</a>. This field, however, had negative values, so I had to compute a new field that only had the positive values that correspond to the actually delayed flights.</p>

<p>I begin my story with a simple bar chart that counts the total number of delayed flights for each month of 2008. The bar chart is side-by-side to make the comparison clearer. After this introduction, I move over to a plot of the average delay for each month, which let&#39;s me see that it gets worse during the holidays. I decided to add the median line as the relationship between it and the average says a lot about the distribution of the data.</p>

<p>Those two visualizations were a nice introduction, so I decided to explore the delay time in a new perspective with a histogram. The distribution of the times is quite skewed so I reduced the x-axis. Furthermore, I added the months as pages so it could be related to the last plot. I checked the option to visualize the past months as faded bars.</p>

<p>Afterwards I returned to the first plot, but this time categorized by the carriers. This allows for a quick comparison between them, as well as to see the number of flights each of them operated that year. As with the last time, I decided to add the month filter for consistency. For easier reading, I had to search for the complete airline names and add them as aliases.</p>

<p>Finally, I decided to add a dashboard that went over the causes for delay. I thought that it would be nice to have the time related to each of those apart from just the count. This visualization was tricky to build, but I&#39;m satisfied with the result. The month and carrier filter show up again, for consistency.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>Feedback was very valuable for this project. I showed the <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/enrique2711#!/vizhome/FlightDelays2008/Story">first version</a> of the story to two people and collected their thoughts:</p>

<h3>Person #1 (Engineering student)</h3>

<ul>
<li>The histograms axis are lacking titles so it&#39;s not easy to understand what it&#39;s supposed to be about</li>
<li>The per-airline plot has two titles which confuse the reading.</li>
<li>Cannot know which airline is which.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Person #2 (Law student)</h3>

<ul>
<li>The visualization is too large for their PC&#39;s screen and they have to scroll a lot.</li>
<li>Histograms have no x-axis title, and the first one has marks while the second one doesn&#39;t.</li>
<li>Needs the full airline name instead of the code.</li>
<li>Each plot should have a legend to know what the colored parts refer to.</li>
<li>Would be nice to see the delay distribution over time, with the other months faded in the background.</li>
<li>More fun and interactive.</li>
</ul>

<p>There were some common items in both, especially regarding the histograms. Due to this I decided to focus on fixing those: add titles and make them have the same marks. However during that time I realized that having two histograms on different scales was not very productive, so I got rid of the first one.</p>

<p>Another common point was the airline names. No normal person knows the codes to every airline so it was mandatory that I fixed it.</p>

<p>Person #2&#39;s feedback included many things I hadn&#39;t thought about, including the size of the story and legends (I thought it was self-explanatory when it wasn&#39;t). I incorporated the feedback and added filters to more plots, as well as legends. The result was a much more streamlined story, more interactive as well. Readers could now easily visualize changes over time.</p>

<p>I actually showed the visualization to a third person before uploading, which helped me identify some little mistakes involving tooltips before publishing it. The <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/enrique2711#!/vizhome/FlightDelays2008v2/Story">second version</a> was complete.</p>

<h3>Udacity review</h3>

<p>After submitting the second version for review, I received more feedback. In the bar plots, bars were stacked on top of eachother, which was fine, but, it would be better if they were side-by-side. This way, it&#39;s easier to compare the values by comparing heights. This change was also applied to the carriers plot. 
A second point of feedback was that the chart would benefit from having a way to select multiple months at the same time. According to this, I replaced the month filters with multiple-value ones. Furthermore, I looked over the rest of the filters and replaced those I found lacking with better options. For example, in the final slide, I updated the carrier dropdown to a list to make better use of the space available.
Finally, some labelling was changed to a better languange; less academic. I also changed some colors to a more muted palette. All of the feedback was taken into account for the <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/enrique2711#!/vizhome/FlightDelays2008v3/Story">third version</a>. </p>
